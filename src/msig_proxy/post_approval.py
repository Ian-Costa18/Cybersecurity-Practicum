"""Post-approval dispatch: what each service type does at a terminal outcome.

When an Approval Request reaches a terminal state, the proxy hands off to whatever
that service type produces (CONTEXT.md §Post-Approval Object). This module owns the
*producer* side of that handoff — the :class:`PostApprovalHandler`, one per service
type — and the :func:`finalize` dispatcher that routes a terminal request to it.

The split from :mod:`msig_proxy.executor`: the executor holds the side-effecting
*primitives* (publish to PyPI, issue a grant); this module decides *which* primitive
runs for *which* service type on *which* terminal state. Keeping dispatch here, and
primitives there, means the dependency points one way (``post_approval`` → ``executor``)
with no cycle — the handler is never hung off the ``ApprovalRequest`` model, which
stays a pure data leaf (CONTEXT.md §Post-Approval Handler).

A handler owns its service type's *work* on every terminal path (``on_approved`` /
``on_denied`` / ``on_cancelled``) plus any notification specific to that work (the
one-time outcome email). The denial notification is identical across types, so it
stays in :func:`finalize`.
